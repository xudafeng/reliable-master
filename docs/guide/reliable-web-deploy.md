## Docker Deploy

### Using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (recommended)

## production

```
# start services
$ docker-compose -p reliable -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# NOTE: if you meet the problem, maybe the issue caused by the existed service, just run the stop command below.

# stop services
$ docker-compose -p reliable -f docker-compose.yml down
```

execute `docker ps`, we can see:

```
